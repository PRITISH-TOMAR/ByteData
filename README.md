# **ByteData — Product Requirements**

## **1. Core Product Requirements**

1. **Run as a web service** (HTTP/gRPC APIs).
    
2. **Cross-platform support**, initially targeting **Linux**.
    
3. **Configurable storage per client**:
    
    - In-memory
        
    - Disk-based (WAL + snapshots)
        
    - Hybrid (indexes in memory, values on disk)
        
4. **Durability**:
    
    - WAL for every write
        
    - Snapshot/checkpoint mechanism for fast recovery
        
    - Configurable fsync frequency
        
5. **Data Model**:
    
    - KV engine + B-tree for ordered/range queries
        
    - Support for multi-key datasets
        
    - Support for composite keys
        
6. **Performance**:
    
    - Fast point lookups (O(1))
        
    - Efficient range queries (O(log N + K))
        
    - Thread-safe and modular for future scaling
        
7. **Security**:
    
    - Optional encryption at rest (WAL & snapshots)
        
    - Optional encryption in transit (API layer)
        
8. **Client Experience**:
    
    - CLI tool for server setup and querying
        
    - Optional Web UI/dashboard (Phase 2+)
        
    - Clients can configure storage mode, paths, memory limits
        
9. **Isolation & Multi-Tenancy**:
    
    - Each client runs their own server instance initially
        
    - Optional multi-tenant single server later
        
10. **Monitoring & Metrics** (Phase 2+):
    
    - Memory usage, WAL size, snapshot info
        
    - Server uptime & active keys

## **2. Phase-Wise Development Roadmap**

### **Phase 1 — Core Storage Engine & APIs**

- In-memory KV + B-tree index
    
- WAL implementation with crash recovery
    
- CLI tool for basic server setup
    
- HTTP API for GET/SET/DELETE/RANGE
    
- Support multi-key and composite keys
    
- Configurable per-client storage mode (memory/disk/hybrid)
    
### **Lightweight CLI Monitoring**

- For small setups, ByteData can ship with CLI commands:
    

``` bash
byted-cli monitor --client alice # Shows: # Uptime: 1h23m # Keys: 10,432 # Memory: 512MB # WAL Size: 120MB # Avg GET latency: 0.8ms # Avg RANGE latency: 5.4ms`
```

- Uses internal stats exposed by the server process.
---

### **Phase 2 — Persistence & Reliability**

- Snapshot/checkpoint system
    
- Full recovery flow: snapshot + WAL replay
    
- Configurable WAL/fsync policies
    
- Optional disk-backed values for large datasets
    
- Add encryption at rest for WAL/snapshots
    
- Basic metrics & monitoring endpoints
    

---

### **Phase 3 — Client Experience & API Enhancements**

- Enhanced CLI for multi-key operations & batch queries
    
- Web-based UI/dashboard for:
    
    - Server configuration
        
    - Key management
        
    - Real-time metrics
        
- Advanced range queries & filtering
    

---

### **Phase 4 — Concurrency & Scaling**

- Thread-safe operations and locks
    
- Optional sharding / multi-instance management
    
- Resource limits per client (memory, keys, request rate)
    
- Optional multi-tenant single server architecture
    

---

### **Phase 5 — Cloud-Ready / Deployment**

- Containerized deployment (Docker + AWS ECS/EC2)
    
- Automated startup scripts & configuration templates
    
- Snapshot backup to cloud storage (S3)
    
- Load balancing / API gateway routing per client
    

---

### **Phase 6 — Advanced Features (Optional)**

- Atomic multi-key transactions
    
- TTL / expiration on keys
    
- Secondary indexes (e.g., for non-key attributes)
    
- Metrics & Prometheus integration
    
- Replication & high availability
    

---

**Summary**

- Phase 1 = **foundation for product** → working server + WAL + KV + range queries.
    
- Phase 2 = durability & reliability
    
- Phase 3 = client usability
    
- Phase 4+ = scaling & cloud readiness
